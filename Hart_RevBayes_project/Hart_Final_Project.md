#### Methods ####
I inferred phylogenetic relationships within the order Percopsiformes utilizing a mitochondrial gene dataset. Novel NADH Dehydrogenase subunit 2 (nd2) sequences and sequences from GenBank were utilized to develop Bayesian phylogenetic hypotheses. 9 sequences were used in the analysis, each a single representative for the species in the order. Tree topology and posterior probabilities were estimated in RevBayes v.1.0.4 (Hohna et al. 2016). For phylogenetic tree generation, a GTR+I+G model was selected. Two independent replicate runs were performed, each with five hundred thousand iterations under default settings.  Approximately, the first fifty thousand generations (10%) were discarded as burn-in.  Following analysis, the phylogenetic trees for each replicate were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.2. Additionally, I visualized and estimated convergence of the replicates with Tracer v.1.6.0.

#### Results ####
Bayesian phylogenies generated from both replicate runs in RevBayes were concordant (Fig. 1 and 2). Values for convergence and mixing were also consistent for both replicate runs (Fig. 3 and 4).
